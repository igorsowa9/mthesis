research ideas and should not be taken as a polished piece of commercial software.  
There is at present no planned maintenance or development continuing.  The creators have 
assumed an all care but no responsibility approach to its release.  Any algorithmic or modelling 
problems that you believe you have discovered would be of interest to the authors along with any 
other constructive criticism.
