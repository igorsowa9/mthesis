         This is a Simple 14 Busbar Test system to Demonstrate LFH.              
         The parameters are taken from the South Island of New Zealand           
         Power System. Have fun trying LFH.     N.R.Watson                       
 SLACK BUSBAR =  B1                                                                                                       
 BASE POWER (MVA) =    100.00000                                                                                                    
 BASE FREQUENCY (Hz) = 50.000000
